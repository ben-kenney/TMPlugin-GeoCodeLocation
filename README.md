# TypingMind Plugin: Return Geocoded Location

My first TypingMind plugin, starting simple by returning a geocoded location based on a supplied city name. 

Uses the [Open-Meteo](https://open-meteo.com/en/docs/geocoding-api#name=Toronto&count=100) service.

After installing this plugin, you can ask something like:

> Return the geocoded location for Toronto, Ontario, Canada.

```
The geocoded location for Toronto, Ontario, Canada is as follows:
Name: Toronto
Latitude: 43.70011
Longitude: -79.4163
Elevation: 175 meters
Country: Canada
Administrative Region: Ontario
Timezone: America/Toronto
Population: 2,600,000
```
